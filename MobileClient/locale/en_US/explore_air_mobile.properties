# Info
info_button_label = Info

no_info_available = No info available
accelerometer_info = This page demonstrates integration with the device's accelerometer. It offers the option to rotate the arrow about the x- or y-axis. This rotation is determined by the movement of the device.
device_camera_info = This page demonstrates integration with the device's camera. It simply passes a URL request to the phone and waits for a photo to be returned.
embedded_camera_info = This page uses the AIR camera support to embed a camera view within the application
email_info = This is a demonstration of a basic email composer. It takes the details entered and passes them in a URL request to the device where they are then picked up by the native email client.
gps_info = This uses the AIR Google maps integration and the device's GPS sensor to find your location. 
local_db_info = This is a demonstration of integration with AIR's local SQLLite database held in the device's storage. You can add and delete entries and see that they are entered into the database.
p2p_chat_info = This uses Adobe's RTMFP to create a P2P chat client. It will send messages to all your 'neighbours' in the P2P network whilst also listening for incoming messages.
maps_info = This demonstrates the AIR Google maps integration. The synchronous initialisation button kicks off the construction of the map. As you can see, this is synchronous as it stops the loading wheel spinning.
internal_browser_info = This demonstrates a basic browser written in AIR using the StageWebView.
