# Info
info_button_label = Info
info_suffix = \ info
no_info_available = No info available
accelerometer_info = This demonstrates integration with the device's accelerometer. The arrow will rotate about the chosen axis as the phone is moved.
device_camera_info = This view requests use of the device's camera. It passes a request to the phone and waits for a photo to be returned. When a photo has been taken it displays it.
embedded_camera_info = This page uses the AIR camera support to embed a camera view within the application using the device's native camera as input.
email_info = This is a demonstration of a basic email composer. It takes the details entered and passes them in a URL request to the device where they are then picked up by the native email client.
gps_info = This uses the AIR Google maps integration and the device's GPS sensor to find your location and display it on a map. This can take a few seconds if you have not used the Google maps integration since you started the application. 
local_db_info = This is a demonstration of integration with AIR's local SQLLite database held in the local storage assigned to the app. You can add and delete entries and see that they are entered into the database.
p2p_chat_info = This uses Adobe's RTMFP to produce a P2P chat client. It will send messages to all your 'neighbours' in the P2P network whilst listening for incoming messages from said neighbours.
maps_info = This demonstrates the AIR Google maps integration. The synchronous initialisation button kicks off the construction of the map. As you can see, this is synchronous and if it's the first time you've used maps in the app, it takes a couple of seconds.
internal_browser_info = This demonstrates a basic browser written in AIR using the StageWebView component. \n\nNote: it is very picky about URLs. Make sure you include 'http://www.' at the beginning!
